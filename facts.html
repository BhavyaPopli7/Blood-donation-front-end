                    &#8594; Donating blood is a safe process. A sterile
                    needle is used only once for each donor and
                    then discarded.

                    <br>
                    &#8594; Blood donation is a
                    simple four-step
                    process: registration,
                    medical history and mini-physical, donation and
                    refreshments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8594; Every blood donor is given a mini-physical,
                    checking the donor&#39;s temperature, blood
                    pressure, pulse and hemoglobin to ensure it is
                    safe for the donor to give blood.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &#8594; The actual blood donation typically takes less
                    than 10-12 minutes. The entire process, from
                    the time you arrive to the time you leave, takes
                    about an hour and 15 min.

                    <br>
                    &#8594; A healthy donor may
                    donate red blood cells
                    every 56 days, or
                    double red cells every 112 days.

                    <br>
                    &#8594; All donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B
                    and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases
                    before it can be transfused to patients.

                        &#8594; There are four types of transfusable products
                        that can be derived from blood: red cells,
                        platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate.
                        Typically, two or three of these are produced
                        from a unit of donated whole blood – hence
                        each donation can help save up

                        <br>
                        &#8594; Donors can give either whole
                        blood or specific blood
                        components only. The process of donating
                        specific blood components – red cells, plasma or
                        platelets – is called apheresis.

                        &#8594; One transfusion dose of platelets can be
                        obtained through one apheresis donation of
                        platelets or by combining the platelets derived
                        from five whole blood donations.
